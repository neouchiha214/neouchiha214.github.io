    <p><strong>What and Why</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Amma coffee thaaa !&rdquo;</p>
<p>has been one constant in my life for the past 15-16 years now. It has
transformed from a mere sentence to an emotion. Over time, I evolved into
an avid coffee drinker, consuming more than the average amount. I began
exploring coffee at various places, delving into the nuances of different
types. In this blog, I will document and share my
experiences with the diverse world of coffee.</p>

    <p><strong>Coffee Bean Choices</strong></p>
<p>Coffee enthusiasts often find themselves captivated by the rich
world of coffee beans, each type offering a unique flavor
and characteristics. In this article, we will delve into the distinct features of
four different coffee beans:</p>
<p>Arabica, Robusta, Excelsa and Liberica.</p>
<p><strong>Arabica</strong> stands as the most widely used and cultivated coffee bean
globally, contributing to almost 60-70% of coffee production.
Known for its mild flavor and aromatic qualities,
Arabica beans are often favored for their complex taste</p>
<p><strong>Robusta</strong> beans are recognized for their higher caffeine content
and a hint of chocolate flavor. However, some describe the
taste as somewhat flat or possessing an almost burnt quality.</p>
<p><strong>Excelsa coffee</strong>, previously categorized as a distinct variant,
has recently been reclassified as a Liberica variant by scientists.
These beans offer a lighter aroma and lower caffeine
content compared to Arabica and Robusta.</p>
<p><strong>Liberica coffee</strong> has earned a reputation for its controversial and
polarizing nature, primarily due to its wild inconsistency</p>

    <p><strong>Traditional South Indian Filter coffee</strong></p>
<p>This is prepared by blending heated milk and sugar with the infusionachieved through
percolation brewing of finely powdered coffee along with chicory in a
conventional Indian filter.</p>
<p>I regard this as the ultimate coffee experience simply because I&rsquo;ve been enjoying
this delightful beverage since my childhood. Yes I&rsquo;m being biased.</p>
<p>There are multiple variations to this as well&hellip;it highly depends on the
amount of chircory and the percentage of Decoction one uses during the preparation
(although some of my friends from college might disagree on this)
It can either enhance the coffee significantly or turn it into a disappointment.</p>
<p>I personally like the version with a slightly higher proportion of chicory
to make it stronger.</p>

    <p><strong>Coffee Choices</strong></p>
<p><em>black</em> - the simplest of all&hellip;fresh coffee beans brewed with hot steaming water</p>
<p><em>espresso</em> - is crafted using finely ground beans and a higher grounds-to-water ratio compared to regular coffee. This process yields a denser, more concentrated liquid with a more robust flavor.</p>
<p><em>latte</em> - this traditional beverage usually consists of one-third espresso and two-thirds steamed milk, crowned with a delicate layer of foam.</p>
<p><em>cappuccino</em> - this coffee creation, rooted in espresso, bears resemblance to a latte, yet distinguishes itself with a denser frothy top layer. The customary proportion comprises equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam.</p>
<p><em>americano</em> - this is espresso but diluted.</p>
<p><em>mocha</em> - are espresso-based drinks, featuring chocolate and whipped cream instead of foam, provide a delightful blend, offering a rich and satisfying experience with every sip.</p>
